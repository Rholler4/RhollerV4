Do I set up a /30 network with the controller and RC car as the only devices?
Can I OSPF my relays?
How do I handle 2, 24fps cameras worth of traffic?
Pi Zero relay?
    Interpretation should not be required for packets so lower resource requirement?
Solar?
Figure out a way to be directional?
    Maybe servo sweep and measure decibels?

Do they then act like repeaters or like routers? Is this dynamic routing
